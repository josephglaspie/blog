I really should blog to not only practice my writting but share some technical issues I have come across in my professional life. Also, Hugo is the cool new hotness so this is a great opportunity to learn more about it. My current role is Senior Systems Engineer at one of the largest retailers in the US. I do 99% of my work in the Azure space. Our Azure subscriptions are IaaS heavy but I am striving towards automating all the things and converting IaaS into PaaS or CaaS (Platform or Containers as a Service).

Hugo is a static site engine written in Go.

It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)
